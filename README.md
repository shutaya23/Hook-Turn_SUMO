# SUMO-Hook-Turn
A Path Planning Algorithm for Scooters Based on the Hook-Turn Constraint and Traffic Information in Urban Environments

## Introduction

Due to the prosperity of information technology, vehicle routing problems have much more feasible manner for designers to achieve their ideas. The favorable path planning algorithms can effectively not only solve the path selection but also ease up many traffic problems, such as the traffic congestion, the traffic control, and the traffic accidents, especially in heavy urban environment. In addition to the Euclidean distance, the road conditions and influence of traffic flow could be used for improving effectiveness of search algorithm as well. Most of path planning algorithms are developed for cars or other large vehicles. In many densely populated countries, however, traffic congestion is commonly observable due to the complex traffic flow, especially in some Asian cities. Therefore, this thesis develops a novel travel navigation system based on hook turn constraint and rerouting policy for scooters with the heavy scooterâ€“vehicle mixed flows in Taiwan. The system can improve the travel efficiency by using the vehicular driving information and the on-road conditions. The proposed algorithm can periodically check the continuous efficiency of the routes, the traffic flow impact, and the traffic light control factors to search for the fastest route for each task scooter. The simulation results show that the navigation system can effectively reduce the travel time for scooter riders in urban environments. This approach substantially decreases the waiting time at the complex intersections.
